THE PROJECT:
This project is to create a card matching game or a Memory Game. The game uses 8 pairs of cards for a total of 16 cards.
The goal of this game is for a player to match two of the similar cards. once they match they cards the cards stay open.
if the player selects two cards that dont match, the cards are removed from the grid.
Once the player has matched all the 8 pairs of cards the game ends.

While the player is playing the game, they can see the number of moves they have made and the time in seconds they have been playing. The game also shows the user their * (star) rating while they are playing.

Each game starts with the player getting 3 starts, but can go down to 2 or 1 stars depending on the number of moves they use.

At the conclusion of the game, the user is shown the final stats in a pop up and the final stats are also displayed on the screen.
